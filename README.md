# ChainEasy-Platform
A chain agnostic, automated, private blockchain network with an integrated wallet. 
This provides users with a single access interface for cross-chain transactions and indirect access to liquidity  
The network itself is the equivalent of liquidity by design.
Contracts on the network hold tokens with accounts that are on the external chains and only increase or decrease these holdings as needed.
The network holds and controls a large pool of individual tokens, across many blockchain networks.
These group of tokens are referred to as the "Liquidity Ocean" and is tokenized within the network as Liquidity Ocean Tokens (LOTS).
The internal blockchain network is referred to as the Liquidity Ocean Automated Network (LOAN).
